## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### If animations don't appear:

1. **Check CSS is loaded**
```bash
# Verify globals.css is imported in layout.tsx
grep "globals.css" src/app/layout.tsx
```

2. **Check browser DevTools**
- Open Inspector
- Look for elements with animation classes
- Check Computed styles for animation properties

3. **Check CSS Custom Properties**
```css
/* In browser console: */
getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--bee-primary')
// Should return: #F59E0B
```

4. **Hard refresh**
```
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```
